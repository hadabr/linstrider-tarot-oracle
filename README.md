# Easy frontend framework setup
for small teams and open source projects
## Project and time management
### Task management
```Tool:``` **quire**  
```Pattern:``` **Kanban-based pattern**  
- main workflow is split into ```ideas```, ```tasks```, ```issues``` and ```blocked``` boards by default; also, ```common``` list

- boards follow columns template: 
TO-DOs &nbsp;⇒&nbsp; In process &nbsp;⇒&nbsp; Completed &nbsp;*or*&nbsp; Postponed

> As here is a simpler approach than Scrum - we have a *non-iterative* one-dimensional flow. Anyway, tasks still can be _postponed_ or *blocked* for a time and reopen later.  

- tasks are moved between boards changing their status

__  
*be sure, that **blocked** will not appear on your Calendar; it can be set as non-tracking board or i.e. board with only *completed* column, which will not appear in the calendar

- sublists
> in case of a complexed macrotask with a lot of subtasks and details, notes or repetitive processes - **when to unfold a task is more important than its deadline**, better to use sublists
